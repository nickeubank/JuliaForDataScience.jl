# 1. Introduction 

This book exists to help newcomers to Julia learn about how to "do data science".  Being a 
general term, we aim to cover a lot of material, not all of which will be useful to you.  

## 1.1 Prerequisites 

This book makes the assumption that you are familiar with some general programming terms as 
well as understand Julia concepts at the level discussed in [0. Why Julia](@ref why-julia).
