# 1. Introduction 

This book exists to help people using Julia for data science.  As *data science* is a 
fairly general term, we aim to cover a wide range of material.  

**We are dedicated to keeping material up to date and focused on Julia 1.0 and beyond**.  
To that end, only packages that are well supported in Julia 1.0 will be covered.  Many existing
tutorials have out-of-date information (e.g. using the old package manager or unmaintained
packages), whereas this book is a "living document" that stays current with the state of data 
science in Julia.

## 1.1 FAQ

### What should I already know?

This book makes the assumption that you are familiar with some general programming terms as 
well as understand Julia concepts at the level discussed in [0. Why Julia](@ref why-julia).  
The following chapters will rely on the fact that you understand core concepts such as Julia's
type system and multiple dispatch.

### What will I learn?

After reading this book, you will be able to read data into Julia, perform exploratory data
analysis, create data visualizations, fit statistical and machine learning models, and create
custom data science tools of your own.
