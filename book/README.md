# Julia for Data Science

This book exists to help people using Julia for data science. As data science is a fairly general term, we aim to cover a wide range of material.

**We are dedicated to keeping material up to date and focused on Julia 1.0 and beyond.**

To that end, only packages that are well supported in Julia 1.0 will be covered. Many existing tutorials have out-of-date information (e.g. using the old package manager or unmaintained packages), whereas this book is a "living document" that stays current with the state of data science in Julia.
